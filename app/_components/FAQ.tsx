      question: "How is this different from regular budgeting software?",
      answer:
        "Traditional budgeting tells you what you've spent. Trinity tells you what you CAN spend today while guaranteeing future obligations are met. It's predictive, not reactive.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my revenue fluctuates?",
      answer:
        "Trinity recalculates everything in real-time. Revenue spike? More capacity. Slow week? It adjusts allocations to keep you safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do penalties work?",
      answer:
        "Think of penalties like a financial hangover - they reduce your daily capacity but fade over time. A £10/day penalty might drop to £5/day after 6 months.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I override Trinity's suggestions?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Trinity provides options and recommendations, but you always make the final decision. It's your advisor, not your boss.",
    },
    {
      question: "What businesses benefit most?",
      answer:
        "Any business with irregular expenses and regular income: agencies, consultancies, retail, construction, restaurants - if cash flow keeps you up at night, Trinity helps.",
